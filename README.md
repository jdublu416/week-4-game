# CrystalsCollector

This project originated as a homework assignment for the University of Richmond Bootcamp. The object of the assignment is to learn the use of random numbers while deepening one's understanding of all the previously learned topics to include HTML/CSS, jquery/javascript, media queries, and global/local scope.

The game is based on a target number (randomly chosen) and four gems that are assigned a hidden (random) value. The User has to figure out the value of each gem and continue clicking the necessary gem combination to reach the target score. The user will be able to reset the game and restart a new game after game play is over. The game board keeps track of the User's wins and losses.
After each click of a gem image, the total score will increment by the value of the gem.

The User will be notified after each click of their next option: choose again, you win, or you lose.
